# Retail Analytics and Reporting

This project, "Retail_Analytics_and_Reporting-postgres-airflow-and-dbt", is a comprehensive system for managing and analyzing data from a network of retail shops. It integrates PostgreSQL for data storage, Apache Airflow for workflow management, and dbt (data build tool) for data transformation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a robust solution for retail data management and analytics. It encompasses:

- Data storage using PostgreSQL
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes managed by Apache Airflow
- Data transformation and modeling using dbt
- Automated scheduling of data processing tasks

## System Architecture

```
[Data Sources] -> [PostgreSQL] -> [Airflow] -> [dbt] -> [Analytics Dashboard]
```

- PostgreSQL: Stores raw data from retail operations
- Airflow: Orchestrates the entire ETL process
- dbt: Transforms raw data into analytics-ready models

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Apache Airflow 2.0+
- dbt 0.21+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/majipa007/Retail_Analytics_and_Reporting-postgres-airflow-and-dbt-.git
   cd Retail_Analytics_and_Reporting-postgres-airflow-and-dbt-
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Configuration

1. Configure PostgreSQL connection in `airflow/airflow.cfg`
2. Set up dbt profile in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`
3. Configure Airflow DAGs in `airflow/dags/`
4. Set up dbt models in `dbt/models/`

## Usage

1. Start Airflow webserver:
   ```
   airflow webserver --port 8080
   ```

2. Start Airflow scheduler:
   ```
   airflow scheduler
   ```

3. Access Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080`

4. Trigger DAGs manually or let them run on schedule

## Data Flow

1. Raw data is ingested into PostgreSQL tables
2. Airflow DAGs trigger data extraction and loading processes
3. dbt models transform raw data into analytics-ready formats
4. Transformed data is loaded back into designated PostgreSQL tables
5. Analytics dashboards can connect to these final tables for reporting

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor Airflow tasks through the Airflow UI
- Check dbt model status using `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`
- Regularly backup PostgreSQL databases
- Keep all components (Airflow, dbt, PostgreSQL) updated to their latest stable versions
